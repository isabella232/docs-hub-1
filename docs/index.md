## Overview

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
This is the documents hub for the PIXEL project (https://pixel-ports.eu/). <br/>

PIXEL is the first smart, flexible and scalable solution for reducing environmental impacts while enabling the optimization of operations in port ecosystems through IoT.<br/>

PIXEL enables a two-way collaboration of ports, multimodal transport agents and cities for optimal use of internal and external resources, sustainable economic growth and environmental impact mitigation, towards the Ports of the Future. Built on top of the state-of-the art interoperability technologies, PIXEL centralises data from the different information silos where internal and external stakeholders store their operational information. PIXEL leverages an IoT based communication infrastructure to voluntarily exchange data among ports and stakeholders to achieve an efficient use of resources in ports.

PIXEL has been financed by the Horizon 2020 initiative of the European Commission, contract 769355

## Architecture

<div style="text-align: justify">
The PIXEL architecture is divided into several building blocks to cover a wide range of needs for small, medium and large ports. The approach is data-centric so that multiple stakeholders and applications can homogeneously access to the data and provide added value services on top of them.

## Data Models

The PIXEL Data Models are based on FIWARE data models 

   - Check [FIWARE Data Models](https://fiware-datamodels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
   - Check [methodology latest documentation](https://inter-iot.readthedocs.io/projects/intermeth/en/latest/)


## Models

The PIXEL models cover Port-city, energy, intermodal transport and environment 

  - Check [Models latest documentation](https://inter-iot.readthedocs.io/projects/intermeth/en/latest/)


## Predictive Algorithms (PAs)

The PIXEL predictive algorithms are able to make future predictions for port traffic, vessel arrivals, etc. 

  - Check [PAs latest documentation](https://inter-iot.readthedocs.io/projects/intermeth/en/latest/)

## Data Acquistion Layer (DAL)

The DAL allows accessing data from heterogeneous sources (sensors, services, open data) 

  - Check [DAL latest documentation](https://inter-iot.readthedocs.io/projects/intermeth/en/latest/)


## Information Hub (IH)   

The IH is the central repository of data (latest and historical) 

  - Check [IH latest documentation](https://inter-iot.readthedocs.io/projects/interapi/en/latest/)
  
 
##  Operational Tools (OTs)

The OT are able to run the models and predictive algorithms deployed in the PIXEL platform 

  - Check [OT latest documentation](https://inter-iot.readthedocs.io/projects/framework/en/latest/)  
  
  
## Dashboard and Notification (DN)

The DN is the user interface for port operators/stakeholders to build their own dashborad and notifications  

  - Check [DN latest documentation](https://inter-iot.readthedocs.io/projects/gateway/en/latest/)


## Security and Privacy (S&P)

The S&P is a cross-layer module intended to provide security to the whole platform  

  - Check [S&P latest documentation](https://inter-iot.readthedocs.io/projects/gateway/en/latest/)
